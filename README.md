<h1 align="center" id="title">Linear Regression Data Science ML / IA</h1>

<p id="description">In this project we embarked on a journey exploring the realms of linear regression using the powerful tools provided by scikit-learn a library cherished by AI and ML enthusiasts. Armed with a dataset brimming with potential insights we delved into the task of comparing two variables. Utilizing the trusty functions like LinearRegression() and train_test_split() we orchestrated a symphony of data analysis seeking patterns and correlations to illuminate our understanding. With each iteration we ventured closer to unraveling the secrets hidden within the data guided by the unwavering beacon of curiosity and the precision of machine learning algorithms.</p>
